# Defination
Multithreading allows a program to appear to execute multiple tasks concurrently. It achieves this by dividing the program into smaller, independent units called threads. The operating system rapidly switches between these threads, giving the illusion of parallelism.

Here we are using **Matrices.py** to create random matrices which are further used by **multithreading.py**

## Files
Multi_threading.py : Contains the main script to execute the multithreaded matrix multiplication and analyze the performance.

matrices.py: Module to generate random matrices for multiplication.

README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions, and analysis.
